# Roman Numeral Generator implimented in PHP

### RomanNumeralGeneratorVanilla

Vanilla PHP implementation of the Roman Numeral Generator built through the following technologies:

- PHP
- PHPUnit for TDD Unit Testing
- Bootstrap for a web frontend

### RomanNumeralGeneratorSlimPHP

JSON API implementation of the previously developed class. I abstracted returned values into JSON and the SlimPHP framework to define RESTful 'GET' endpoints.
